# GHGsites_scripts
Stores original 'SimCity' scripts that processes GHG (CO2, CH4) observations from various stations in Utah (see https://air.utah.edu)
This code is after the data pipeline series of code that communicates with the instruments and downloads the data to University of Utah's CHPC clusters.
The data pipeline code can be found at:  https://github.com/uataq/data-pipeline
